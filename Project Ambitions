My goal for this project was to eventually ouput restaurant reviews and sentiment scores for those reviews to offer 
a suggestion for whether to eat there or not. Unfortunately, the code was a little too complicated for me to be able
to scrape review data using Google Places API, and that part of the project never came to fruition. Had I been able to
make the code work properly, the reviews would have output correctly and then ran through sentiment analyis. From there,
the 'label' key returned from the sentiment analysis would have been put through an 'if' statement like this:

if sentiment['label'] == 'pos':
    print('Reviews of %s are positive! You should eat there!' % name)
else:
    print('Reviews of %s are not good. Consider eating somewhere else.' % name)
